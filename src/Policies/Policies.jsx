                      <h4>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h4>
                       Last updated on Nov 20th 2023
                      Extrovert believes in helping its customers as far as
                      possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy.
                      Under this policy: Cancellations will be considered only
                      if the request is made immediately after placing the
                      order. However, the cancellation request may not be
                      entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
                      vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of
                      shipping them. Extrovert does not accept cancellation
                      requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc.
                      However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer
                      establishes that the quality of product delivered is not
                      good. In case of receipt of damaged or defective items
                      please report the same to our Customer Service team. The
                      request will, however, be entertained once the merchant
                      has checked and determined the same at his own end. This
                      should be reported within of receipt of the products. In
                      case you feel that the product received is not as shown on
                      the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to
                      the notice of our customer service within of receiving the
                      product. The Customer Service Team after looking into your
                      complaint will take an appropriate decision. In case of
                      complaints regarding products that come with a warranty
                      from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In
                      case of any Refunds approved by the Extrovert, itâ€™ll take
                      for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
